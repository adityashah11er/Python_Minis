#indentations matter since python doesnt require any brakets most of the time..
#hence if print is inside the for loop it will have such indentation..
# otherwise it will be outside the for loop like this 

#list=[......]
# for a in list:
#     print(a)---> will be inside the loop
#print(list) -----> will be outside the loop
